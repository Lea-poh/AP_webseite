I am a retired professor of econometrics at the [University of Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/university/) and a senior professor of Computational Statistics at the [Zeppelin University](https://www.zeppelin-university.com/) in Friedrichshafen.

My main main areas of research are machine learning, microeconometrics and financial econometrics.
